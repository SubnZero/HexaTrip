HexaTrip - SideScroller Hexagon Jump and Run
============================================

HexaTrip is a experiment for me to see if i can handle with LWJGL and Java.. not more not less.

My Overall TODO List
--------------------
  - add character and implement jump physics
  - add INTRO, MAINMENU, GAMEOVER and END/CREDITS
  - add Level Editor
  - add Textures (SpriteMap)
  - add Music (I can play guitar, will be a nice practice)
  - (add a story..)
